	* improve doc of cs_truthTable
	* eliminate missing data automatically in cs_truthTable and fs_truthTable.
	* when nlevels is mismatched, throw a warning and use possible value instead of stop.

	* new function of bestSubsets(), changed to findNoCSA().
	* change version number to 0.1-3 (0.1-2 is a bugfix version for R-2.10-0).

	* use esubSet in reduce.default, and rename original reduce.default to reduceOld for calibration purpose.
	* minor change of esubSet to handle implicant without NAs.
	* new function necessaryIndex.

2009-10-08
	* fix bugs of esubSet(): correctly handle MV. need more tests.

2009-10-07
	* reduce.default(): set dim to NULL rather than use as.vector to speed it up.
	* new function esubSet(), intended to superpose subSet(). It is much faster, but need more tests (seems ok for all 2-levels).
